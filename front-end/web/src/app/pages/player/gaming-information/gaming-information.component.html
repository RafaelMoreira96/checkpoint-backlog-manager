            Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts
            it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of
            blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far
            World of Grammar.

            The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands
            of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the
            Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. She packed her seven versalia,

            Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a
            thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be
            the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
            return to its own, safe country.

            But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didnâ€™t take
            long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk
            with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they
